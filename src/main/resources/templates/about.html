					<p class="bg-secondary font-italic font-weight-light px-5 py-2">Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU), before
						2015 known as the Uttar Pradesh Technical University (UPTU), is a
						public collegiate university in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. It
						was established as the Uttar Pradesh Technical University through
						the Government of Uttar Pradesh on 8 May 2000. To reduce workload
						and to ensure proper management, the university was bifurcated
						into separate universities, Gautam Buddh Technical University
						(GBTU) and Mahamaya Technical University (MTU), with effect from 1
						May 2010.[2] In 2013, as a new government came into power, the
						university was formed again by combining the two on 5 January
						2013.[3] It is an affiliating university, with approximately 800
						colleges affiliated to it.[4] The university was earlier on the
						IET Lucknow campus. Now it is in its newly inaugurated campus in
						Jankipuram, Lucknow. Additionally, the university had a Centre and
						Regional Office in Noida, Uttar Pradesh.[5] History Dr. A.P.J.
						Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow formerly known as Uttar
						Pradesh Technical University (UPTU), was established by the
						government of Uttar Pradesh on 8 May 2000 (Act No. 1248
						(2)XVII-V-I-I-19-2000 Uttar Pradesh Adhiniyam Sankhya 23 of 2000).
						Under the University Act, 'Technical Education' includes
						programmes of education, research, and training in engineering,
						technology, architecture, town planning, pharmacy, applied arts
						and crafts, and such other programmes and areas that the central
						government may declare by notification in the Gazette in
						consultation with All India Council for Technical Education
						(AICTE).[5] The university was bifurcated into the Mahamaya
						Technical University and Gautam Buddha Technical University as of
						1 May 2010 for better management of education in the state. On 1
						May 2013, the Uttar Pradesh government decided to merge GBTU and
						MTU to bring back the original form of UPTU. On 31 October 2013,
						GBTU (Gautam Buddha Technical University, Lucknow) and MTU
						(Mahamaya Technical University, Noida) merged back to with old
						name UPTU (Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow), the
						university with the maximum number of colleges affiliated to it,
						in India.[2] On 18 September 2015, the university was officially
						renamed as Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University.[6] In
						February 2023, Alok Kumar Rai was appointed the vice-chancellor
						(additional charge) of the university.[7] Overview The university
						is affiliating in nature and its jurisdiction spanned the state of
						Uttar Pradesh. It is one of the largest technical universities in
						India and perhaps in Asia. Because of its size, the number of
						colleges affiliated with it, and geographic dispersion, it is
						sub-divided into five zones with 150â€“160 colleges in each zone for
						the ease of management and facilitating inter-zonal comparison and
						possible internal competition to enhance the quality of
						teaching-learning processes.[5] The university envisioned to
						facilitate and nurture quality technical education and research in
						its own premises as well as all affiliated institutions. There
						were 49 affiliated colleges in 2000, now in August 2019, 785
						colleges and institutions. The task of the university included
						conducting the SEE-UPTU for admission to programs affiliated with
						it.</p>
